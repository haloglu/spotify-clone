# spotify-clone

Welcome to the Spotify Clone Project, a project built with Vue JS, Vue 3, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Pinia.

This app provides a basic implementation of a music streaming service that includes a home page, a search page (not functional), and a library page with pre-loaded songs. The library page allows users to play and pause tracks, skip to the next or previous track, and save their favorite tracks. üéß
